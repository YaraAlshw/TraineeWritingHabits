### Code in this repository

* [SentimentAnalysis.R](<code/SentimentAnalysis.R>): Code for running the sentiment analysis using R package [tidytext](<https://www.tidytextmining.com/sentiment.html>). Ultimately we went with unanimous co-author agreement because too many of our words were missing from established sentiment dictionaries. The results from these analyses closely match the one in the paper.
